<div class="text">I have always wanted to continue and inherit the work of my parents, the opening of businesses for the good of the city. Every day more and more we are seeing the opening of fast foods and in fact, the increased interest of people to consume them, even though they are aware of their damage to health. That is why one day a special idea and innovation came to me for Shkodra, to open in the future a restaurant only with organic food. This fulfills my desire to spread my new ideas. We make the difference, because the restaurant will also have its own corner for the store-market "Health & Organics", where you can do your organic shopping, with controlled fruits and vegetables, fresh milk, cheese and organic honey. A little further you will find yourself in peace and relaxation, as we offer essential oils, very effective medicinal plants for health problems and handmade soaps. This initiative will obviously enable farmers and gardeners to sell their products with quality. We hope that this business will encourage you to make healthy food part of your lifestyle! </div>
